*Hard ask · Time-bound reason to act · Revenue trigger*

### 1 | Purpose & Timing

| What it does | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| • Converts banked trust into trials, sales, or upgrades.• Presents a clear, unequivocal purchase decision—price, benefit stack, urgency/scarcity.• Signals a “moment of action,” then smoothly returns readers to value emails. | **3 stand-alone O emails** inside every 30-touch evergreen cycle (≈ 10 %).Seasonal promos or launches can drop in as extra O emails—just keep the regular value cadence running so the overall ratio stays healthy. |

### 2 | Core Ingredients

| Ingredient | Why it matters | Quick example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Urgency headline** | Marks this as an action email. | “48 hrs left: 30 % off CC360 🚀” |
| **Benefit stack** | Leads with the outcome, not features. | “Launch faster · Replace $5k/mo stack · Unlimited students.” |
| **Offer specifics** | Price, discount, bonuses, guarantee, deadline. | “$297/mo → $207/mo until Fri 11:59 PM PT.” |
| **Proof snippet** | Removes doubt with social proof. | “4,211 creators switched in 2024.” |
| **Single CTA button/link** | One path only—checkout or start trial. | “Start My 30-Day Free Trial” |
| **FAQ / objection line (opt.)** | Pre-handles the #1 blocker. | “Still on Kajabi? Free migration in 24 hrs.” |

### 5 | Pitfalls to Dodge

1. **Multiple CTAs** – one button, no forks.
2. **Weak or missing deadline** – urgency is Offer oxygen.
3. **Feature dump without outcome** – lead with transformation.
4. **Over-frequency** – >3 stand-alone O emails per 30-touch cycle erodes goodwill.
5. **Broken links/timers** – test on mobile and desktop before send.

### 6 | Relationship to Other Bricks

- **Lead-in/Engage foundation:** Always place at least one Engage or hybrid Engage-Guide email before an Offer. Cold lists don’t convert.
- **Post-purchase routing:** Tag buyers or trial-starters to skip subsequent O emails and enter onboarding while the rest of the list flows back to value-heavy Engage content.

Master the **Offer** brick and you’ll monetise trust without draining it—keeping subscribers eager for the next insight instead of bracing for another pitch.
