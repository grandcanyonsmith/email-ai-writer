*Soft invitation · Moves the curious closer · Often hides inside an Engage*

### 1 | Purpose & Timing

| What it does | How it appears |
| --- | --- |
| • Turns passive readers into active prospects—demo, deeper training, survey, comparison, or FAQ. • Bridges the trust earned by *E-mails* to the eventual *Offer.* • Lets you qualify interest without pressure. | **Two flavors• Hybrid E+G** – the value lesson comes first (80 %+ of the copy) and a single soft CTA sits at the end, often in a P.S.**• Stand-alone G** – the entire email is built to warm the click, but still gives a nugget of insight up-front. |

*Because hybrids are common, your actual send count may include more G’s than the 7 standalone bricks in the 30-email rhythm; that’s fine—the ratios refer to pure bricks.*

### 2 | Core Ingredients

| Ingredient | Why it matters | Quick example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value spark** | Even a pure Guide delivers *one* insight or stat first. | “Founders who delegate sales 2× sooner grow 30 % faster…” |
| **Soft CTA** | Clear, no-pressure next step (demo, template vault, workshop application). | “Book a 10-min strategy call here.” |
| **Credibility cue** | Social proof or authority line to justify the ask. | “Used by 67 portfolio CEOs.” |
| **Low-friction wording** | Removes buying language; frames as help or exploration. | “See if you’re a fit…” / “Grab the walkthrough…” |

### 3 | Five Proven *G* Variations

---

| Variation | Best-fit scenario | Extra tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Book-a-Call (demo / discovery / consult)** | Any sales conversation where the real conversion happens on Zoom or phone. | Offer 2–3 time slots or drop a Calendly link; frame as “see if we’re a fit,” not “book a sales call.” |
| **Workshop / Webinar Application** | High-ticket event or program that needs pre-qualification. | Position the call as a mutual fit check to keep friction low. |
| **Case-Study Deep Dive** | Teach + tease a fuller success story. | Link to a PDF or video; no squeeze page. |
| **Tool Vault Unlock** | Offer a folder of SOPs, swipe files, or templates. | Mention exact file count/size for curiosity. |
| **Survey / Reply Ask** | Market research + invisible qualifier. | Promise to send compiled results to participants. |

### 4 | Plain-Text Mini Templates

### A. Hybrid E + G (value first, ask second)

Subject: The 3P test before every hire

Most leaders over-hire because they solve a short-term problem with a long-term payroll bill.

Run the 3P filter first:
1. Process – will a system fix this?
2. Project – is it a 90-day sprint?
3. Person – only if it’s truly ongoing work.

I dropped a 5-minute Loom showing exactly how we apply 3P.

► Watch the Loom (no opt-in)

PS – If you’d like our full hiring playbook, grab a 10-min slot with my team here and we’ll see if the Vegas Scaling Workshop is a fit.

### B. Stand-Alone Guide (demo invite)

Subject: Want me to walk you through the new automation builder?

Quick heads-up: we just rebuilt the course-launch automation inside CC360.

Tomorrow I’m hosting two 20-minute live demos:
•  9 AM PT
•  1 PM PT

Pick a time here and bring your toughest workflow question.

See you on the call,
Stockton

### 5 | Pitfalls to Dodge

1. **Pitch creep** – keep language exploratory, not transactional.
2. **Multiple CTAs** – one path per email.
3. **Value-less Guide** – always open with a useful nugget before the ask.
4. **Hidden paywalls** – soft CTA must lead straight to the promised next step or a no-obligation booking page.

### 6 | How *G* Coexists with *E*

| Scenario | How to count it | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engage email with a P.S. demo invite | Still counts as **E** (hybrid) | 80 %+ of copy is value; ask is optional follow-up. |
| Short email whose sole focus is “book a workshop chat” with a quick tip upfront | Counts as **G** | Primary purpose is the soft invitation. |
