### 1 | Purpose & Timing

| What it does | When it fires |
| --- | --- |
| • Delivers teachable moments, inspiration, or quick wins that leave the reader better off. • Demonstrates authority without overt self-promotion. • Keeps the brand top-of-mind so future Guides and Offers feel welcome. | Forms the backbone of every sequence—about **18 of the 30 emails** in the evergreen cycle (≈ 60 %). |

*(Length is flexible: write as much or as little as the idea needs—clarity beats word-count rules.)*

### 2 | Core Ingredients

| Ingredient | Why it matters | Quick example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Hook + curiosity gap** | Stops the scroll and promises a payoff. | “The $11 typo that saved our launch.” |
| **Value payload** | Tip, story, data, or tool that fulfils the hook—no selling. | Bullet framework, screenshot, or mini story. |
| **Helpful link** | Points to deeper *free* help—video, template, doc, or checklist. | “Watch the Loom breakdown here.” |
| **Conversation spark (optional)** | Invites a reply, poll, or micro-survey to keep engagement human. | “Hit reply with your biggest launch bottleneck.” |

### A. Quick-Win Tutorial

Subject: Cut refund requests in half with one email

Ever notice most refund emails start the same way?

“Hey, I never even used the course…”

Here’s the 3-step sequence that slashed our refunds by 52 % last quarter:

1. Day 2: “How is setup going?” (video walkthrough link)
2. Day 7: Success story from a student who felt stuck at first.
3. Day 20: Progress checkpoint—ask them to rate momentum 1-5.

### B. Relatable Founder Story

Subject: I deleted my entire Instagram—here’s why it paid off

2018. Zero sales, 1,700 “likes,” and a daily dose of imposter syndrome.

So I nuked the account.

The silence forced me to build an email list instead—500 subscribers in 30 days. That tiny list funded version 1 of CC360.

Lesson: vanity reach ≠ revenue. Build owned channels first.

What vanity metric could you scrap this week? Reply and let me know—I’ll share the best answers.

### 5 | Pitfalls to Dodge

1. **Sneak-selling**—any whiff of a hidden pitch erodes trust.
2. **Multi-topic rambles**—one idea per email keeps impact high.
3. **No payoff**—if the hook promises a fix, deliver the fix.
4. **Dead-end content**—most Engage emails should link to deeper *free* help or invite conversation.

Master the **Engage** brick and subscribers will open with anticipation—paving the way for the softer Guides and the occasional Offers that actually convert.
